## Briefly About Myself:

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

## Skills and Proficiency:

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Sample code:

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string.

Here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

Example (Input --> Output)

"Hello World" --> "World Hello"

"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"

```
 function reverse(string){
  let arr = string.split(' ')
  let newStr= arr.reverse().join(' ')
  return newStr
 }
```
